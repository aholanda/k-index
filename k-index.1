.SH NAME
k-index - calculate the K-index using data files in TSV (tab-delimited
values) format from Web of Science.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B k-index

.B k-index
file

.B k-index
file...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B k-index
reads input file(s) with information about citings of an author
articles, among others, of a researcher and find out where the
position of an article is greater or equal than the number of
citings. This position is the so called \fB K-index\fR.

If no arguments are passed to the program, \fBk-index\fR will read
\fBidentifiers.dat\fR and get all authors' identifier in the 1st
column. The convention is that all files with articles' authors
citings are placed inside \fBdata/\fR directory with author's
identifier as prefix of the file name with extension \fI.tsv\fR.  For
example, if an author has \fB1234abcd\fR as identifier, her/his data
is encountered inside a file named \fB./data/1234abcd.tsv\fR.  All
existing files inside \fBdata/\fR directory are processed in batch
mode.

If a one or several arguments are passed to the program, they must
be the data files in TSV format. The output is the file name and the
K-index after it.

.SH NOTES
The data files must be in the format adopted by Web of Science. To download
author's citings, the following procedure can be performed:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 4
Search for an author's publications at https://app.webofknowledge.com;
.IP \n+[step]

to the author identifier and the extension can be mantained
untouched. Copy the renamed file to \fBdata/\fR directory.
Append the author identifier value to the file \fIidentifiers.dat\fR.
