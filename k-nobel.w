@** Introduction. K-NOBEL is a project to try to predict the next
winners of Nobel prize of physics using $K$-index as parameter of
comparison. Another parameter, $h$-index, is used to evaluate the
error threshold, since $h$-index is used by Web of Science as one of
the parameters to predict the winners of Nobel prize.

The program has the following structure:

@c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
@<Include files@>@;
@<Data structures@>@;
@<Internal variables@>@;
@<Static functions@>@;

@ @c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    @<Parse program arguments@>@;
    @<Load the ids of authors laureated with Nobel@>@;
    @<Load authors information@>@;
    @<Calculate h index@>@;
    @<Calculate K index@>@;
    @<Sort the authors@>@;
    @<Write results to a file@>@;
    @<Write a table with the twelve larger ks in latex format@>@;
    @<Free up memory@>@;
    return 0;
}

@ Some internal functions are defined to embed repetitive tasks like check null
pointers and print error messages.

@<Static...@>=
static FILE *Fopen(char *filename, char *mode) {
       FILE *f;

       f = fopen(filename, mode);
       if (!f) {
       	  fprintf(stderr, "Could not open %s\n", filename);
	  exit(-1);
       }
       return f;
}

static void Fclose(FILE *f) {
       if (f)
       	  fclose(f);
}

@ The only flag provided is {\tt -v} to print the existing comments
inside data files and any other useful information to the user.

@d VERBOSE_FLAG  "-v"

@<Parse program arguments@>=
if (argc==2 && !strncmp(argv[1], VERBOSE_FLAG, 3)) {
   verbose = 1;
}

@ The |verbose| variable stores if the output of the program is
extended.  The default behavior is to write to output few information
about the generated files.

@<Internal...@>=
static int verbose;

@** Authors. Information about research authors were stored into
{\tt index.csv} file. They consist into name, Web of Science or Google
Scolar or Publons research id and a link to a page containing more
information about the citations. Not all authors have research id,
 when this occurs, we assign a number and link to the Web of Science
 page. The data structure for author loads this information, and indeed
  the author's $h$-index and $K$-index.

@d MAX_STR_LEN 256

@<Data structures@>=
struct author {
    char name[MAX_STR_LEN];
    char researchid[MAX_STR_LEN];
    char url[MAX_STR_LEN];
    int h;
    int k;
};

@ An array of structs is used to store the |authors|' information.
|MAX_LINE_LEN| is the maximum length of each line, the value is very
high because some papers have so many authors as collaborators.
 Some variables are made internal (static) and global because the
 program is so short and the risk to have inconsistencies is low.
 This kind of programming imposes an attention to details along the
 program to not forget to restart the counters, for example.

@d MAX_LINE_LEN 1<<16

@<Internal...@>=
static struct author **authors; /* store authors' info */
static struct author *aut;
static char *fn, *p; /* file name and generic pointer */
static FILE *fp; /* file pointer */
static char buffer[MAX_STR_LEN]; /* buffer to carry strings */
static char line[MAX_LINE_LEN]; /* store file lines */
static int A=0; /* number of authors */
static int i=0, j=0; /* general-purpose counters */

@ Authors basic information was picked at the Web of Science page,
more specifically at \hfil\break {\tt
https://hcr.clarivate.com/\#categories\%3Dphysics} that is the page of
highly cited authors in physics. They are stored in a file named
|authors.idx| that is openned to load this information. The global
counter |A| stores the number of authors and it is used along the
program.

@<Load authors info...@>=
fn = "authors.idx";
fp = Fopen(fn, "r");
while (fgets(line, MAX_LINE_LEN, fp) != NULL) {
      if (is_comment(line))
      	 continue;

      /* reallocate the array of authors struct with to pointer elements */
      authors = (struct author**)realloc(authors, get_no_authors()*sizeof(struct author*));
      @<Begin to fill authors structure@>@;

}
Fclose(fp);

@ The number of research authors is calculated by adding one to global
variable |A| that is the next free array index.

@<Static...@>=
static int get_no_authors() {
       return A+1;
}

@ @<Include...@>=
#include <string.h> /* strtok() */

@ The fields are separated by semicolon inside |authors.idx|, a record in
the file is like

{\tt L-000-000;Joe Doe;http//joedoe.joe}

where the first field {\tt L-000-000} is the Research ID or ORCID,
when the author doesn't have an identifier, a custom
number is assigned. The second field {\tt Joe Doe} is the author name
and the third field is the link to the page containing information
about author's publications. A structure is loades with these data and
a pointer to this structure is passed to the array |authors|.  Lately,
$h$-index and $K$-index will be calculated and assigned to the proper
field in the structure.

@d IDX_SEP ";\n"

@<Begin to fill authors structure@>=
aut = (struct author*)malloc(sizeof(struct author));
i = 0; /* information index */
char *p;
p = strtok(line, IDX_SEP);

        break;
        default:
        break;
    }
    p = strtok(NULL, IDX_SEP);
    i++;
}

if (!is_nobel_laureated(aut)) {
   authors[A++] = aut;
}

@ In all custom files used to parse the data the hash character ''\#''
is used to indicate that after it the following tokens must be
interpreted as comments.

@<Static...@>=
int is_comment(char *line) {
    if (!line)
       goto exit_is_comment;

      if (line[0] == '#') {
            if (verbose)
      	       printf("%s", line);

	    return 1;
     }

    exit_is_comment:
      return 0;
}

@** Nobel laureated researchers. We have to discard researchers that
already was laureated with the prize. Up to 2018, there was 935
Laureates that awarded Nobel prize. We put more chairs in the room to
accomodate future laureated researchers. A simple array is used to
store the ids and a linear search is performed. As the number of
winners is not high, this simple scheme, even though not so efficient,
is used to avoid complexities.

       char array[N_LAUREATED+MORE_ROOM][MAX_STR_LEN];

not take into account if an id is prefix of another one because this
is very unlikely to occur.

       int i;
       char *id = a->researchid;

       for (i=0; i<list.n; i++) {

	      return 1;
       }
       return 0;
}

@** $h$-index. The number of papers in decreasing order of citations
that the number of citations is greater than the paper position is the
$h$-index.  On Web of Science homepage, the procedure to find the $h$ of
an author is as follows:

\begingroup
\parindent=2cm
\item{$\bullet$} Search for an author's publications;
\item{$\bullet$} Click on the link {\it Create Citation Report\/};
\item{$\bullet$} The $h$-index appears on the top of the page.
\endgroup\smallskip

To calculate in batch mode, we downloaded a file with the data to
calculate the $h$ by clicking on the button
\hbox{{\it Export Data: Save To Text File\/}} and
selecting {\it Records from ...\/} that saves the same data, with limit
of 500 records, where each field is separated by comma
that is represented by the macro |CSV_SEP|. The files were saved with
a ".csv" extension inside |DATA_DIRECTORY|. All authors' files are
traversed, parsed and $h$-index is calculated. The results are saved in
a file.

@d DATA_DIRECTORY "data/" /* directory containing all data */
@d H_EXT ".csv" /* file used to calculate h-index extension */

@<Calculate h index@>=
for (i=0; i<A; i++) {/* for each author */
    int h=0; /* temporary h-index */

    @<Process csv file@>@;

    authors[i]->h = h;
}

@ @<Process csv file@>=
strncpy(buffer, DATA_DIRECTORY, sizeof(DATA_DIRECTORY));
strncat(buffer, authors[i]->researchid, sizeof(authors[i]->researchid));
strncat(buffer, H_EXT, sizeof(H_EXT));
fn = buffer;
fp = fopen(fn, "r");
if (fp) {
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), fp) != NULL) {
        @<Parse the line counting citations@>@;
    }
    fclose(fp);
} else {
    perror(fn);
    exit(-2);
}

@ The head of the citations file contains some line that must be
 ignored.  These lines contains the words "AUTHOR", "Article Group
 for:", "Timespan=All" and "\"Title\"" in the beginning of the line
 (ignore double quotes without escape).  There is also an empty line
 or a line that starts with a new line special command. Passing these
 rules, the line is a paper record of the author and is parsed to
 count the number of citations.

@<Parse the line counting citations@>=
if (strstr(line, "AUTHOR") != NULL ||
    strstr(line, "IDENTIFICADORES DE AUTOR:") != NULL ) {
    continue;
} else if (strstr(line, "Article Group for:") != NULL) {
    continue;
} else if (strstr(line, "Timespan=All") != NULL ||
	   strstr(line, "Tempo estipulado=Todos os anos") != NULL) {

	   strstr(line, "\"Autores\",") != NULL) {
    continue;
} else if (line[0] == '\n') { /* start with new line */
    continue;
} else {
    @<Count the citations and check if the h-index was found@>@;
}

@ To count the citations and check if the $h$-index was found, the
line is tokenized generating fields to be evaluated. The marks to
divide the line are set to |CSV_SEP| macro. The first |SKIP_FIELDS|
fields are ignored because contain author's name, paper's name,
journal's name and volume and information that is not citation.
Citations start after |SKIP_FIELDS| and are classified by year
starting in 1900, so the first citations' numbers normally are zero.
In the citations region, they are accumulated until the last year is
found. If their summation is lesser than a counter of papers, the
counter is decremented, and the counter is the $h$-index. This value
is assigned to a field in a structure called author to be written at
the end of the program.

@d CSV_SEP ",\"\n"
@d SKIP_FIELDS 30

        j++;
  }
  if (h > c) { /* found h */
     h--;
     break; /* stop reading file */
  }
  h++;
}

@** $K$-index. If an author receives at least K citations, where each
one of these K citations have get at least K citations, then the
author's $K$-index was found. On Web of Science homepage, the procedure
to find the K of an author is as follows:

\begingroup
\parindent=2cm
\item{$\star$} Search for an author's publications;
\item{$\star$} Click on the link {\it Create Citation Report\/};
\item{$\star$} Click on the link {\it Citing Articles without self-citations\/};
\item{$\star$} Traverse the list, stoping when the rank position of the article were
      greater than the {\it Times Cited\/};
\item{$\star$} Subtract on from the rank position, this is the K value.
\endgroup\smallskip

To calculate in batch mode, we downloaded a file with the data to
calculate the K by clicking on the button {\it Export...\/} and
selecting {\it Fast 5K\/} format that saves the same data, with limit
of 5.000 records, where each field is separated by one or more tabs
that is represented by the macro |TSV_SEP|. The files were saved with
a ".tsv" extension inside |DATA_DIRECTORY|. All authors' files are
traversed, parsed and $K$-index is calculated. The results are saved in
a file.

@ @<Calculate K index@>=
for (i=0; i<A; i++) {/* for each author */

    exit(-2);
}

@ The file with citings has few lines to ignore, basically it's only one
that begins with "PT $\backslash$t" (ignore double quotes). A line that begins
with new line command ignored too, but only for caution.

@ |K_SKIP| represents the fields to be skiped before {\it Times Cited\/}
value is reached. Its value is not fixed and for this reason it was
implemented a tricky way to get the {\it Times Cited\/} value: after
|K_SKIP| is passed, each field is accumulated in a queue and when the
end of the record is reached, the queue is dequeue three times to get
the {\it Times Cited\/} value. This position offset of {\it Times
Cited\/} value from the end is fixed for all files.

@** Queue. A humble queue is implemented to store few pointers using
FIFO policy. The queue is composed by an array of pointers and an index
|idx| that marks the top element of the queue.

@<Internal...@>=
static char *stack[64];
static int idx=0;

@ Elements are inserted at the top of the queue by invoking
|enqueue| and using |char *p| as parameter. The index |idx|
is incremented to the number of elements in the queue and
|idx-1| is the top of the queue.

@<Static...@>=
static void enqueue(char *p) {

@ Elements from the top of the queue are removed by |dequeue|
function. If there is no element in the queue, |NULL| is returned.

@<Static...@>=
static char* dequeue() {

          return NULL;
	else
	  return stack[--idx];

@** Sorting. The authors are classified in descending order
according to their $K$-index. The insertion-sort algorithm
is used to simplify the code and because the number of entries
is not so large.
